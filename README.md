# finite-difference-methods
Algorithms in MATLAB for finite difference methods to solve the vibration ODE and the heat PDE. Sample simulations can be found in the pdf file. 

`diff_euler_back_sine.m` and `diff_euler_fwd_sine.m` solve the heat equation in one dimension using the euler backward and forward methods respectively. The intial function is a sine wave.


`euler_back_vib.m` and `euler_fwd_vib.m` solve the vibration ODE in one dimension using the euler backward and forward methods respectively. 


`verlet_FD.m` solves the vibration ODE in one dimension using the verlet method.

Sample intial datum, plots and more information about the algorithms can be found in `summer_project_2021.pdf`
